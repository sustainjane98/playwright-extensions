# Waiting for optional Elements

Let's discover the possibility to easily wait for optional available elements. So if it isn't available until a timeout you can skip the part.

## Waiting for single elements

### Wait for Selectors

Playwright Extensions allow you to wait for single elements to appear before interacting with them, ensuring reliable script execution. By using the `waitForSelector` function with a specified timeout, you can wait for elements to become visible and interactable, enhancing the stability and robustness of your automated tests.

#### Usage

```js
import { expect, mergeTests } from '@playwright/test';
import {playwrightExtensions} from 'playwright-extensions';
import { common } from '@test/pages';

const test = mergeTests(playwrightExtensions, common);

test.describe('Wait for Selectors', () => {

  test('Wait for Selector without soft error', async ({ playwrightExtensions, page }) => {
    const selector = 'html body h2';

    await playwrightExtensions.waitForSelector(selector, { timeout: 6000 });

    await expect(page.locator(selector)).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```
#### Options
- <p>`options` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) (optional)</p>
  - `timeout` [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type)
<p>Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 0 - no timeout. Defines the time until the `state` should be true </p>
  - <p>`state` "attached" | "detached" | "visible" | "hidden"</p>
  <p>Defaults to `visible`. Can be either:</p>
    - `attached` - wait for the element to be present in the DOM.
    - `detached` - wait for the element to be removed from the DOM.
    - `visible` - wait for the element to be present in the DOM and to be visible.
    - `hidden` - wait for the element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden.


### Wait for Locators

Playwright Extensions can also wait for locators, providing a powerful way to handle dynamic web content. By leveraging the locator method, you can wait for elements matching a specific locator to appear, ensuring your interactions are precise and reliable. This enhances the flexibility and robustness of your automated scripts when dealing with complex and changing web pages.
#### Usage
```js
import { Locator, expect, mergeTests } from '@playwright/test';
import { common } from '@test/pages';
import { TestIds } from '@test/ids';
import { playwrightExtensions } from 'playwright-extensions';

const test = mergeTests(common, playwrightExtensions);

test.describe('Wait For Extensions Test', () => {
  test('Wait for any of two subHeadlines Timeout', async ({
    playwrightExtensions,
    page,
  }) => {
    const subHeadline = page.locator('html').locator('body').getByText('Test124');

    await playwrightExtensions.waitFor(
      subHeadline,
      { timeout: 6000 }
    );

    await expect(subHeadline).toHaveCount(1);
  });
});
```
